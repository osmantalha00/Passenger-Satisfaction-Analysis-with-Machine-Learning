# Passenger Satisfaction Prediction Using Data Mining Techniques

This project applies data mining and machine learning techniques to predict airline passenger satisfaction based on service and flight-related features.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, PCA, and model comparison across six algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, Polynomial Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.

The Random Forest classifier achieved the best performance with 94.8% accuracy, effectively identifying key factors such as flight distance, class, and in-flight services that influence satisfaction.

Key methods used:

Outlier detection and handling

Missing value imputation

Feature encoding and scaling

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation

This study highlights how data-driven insights can be used to improve airline service quality and customer experience.
